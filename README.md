# Atomica

**Atomica** is a 2D particle simulator written in C# using the MonoGame framework. The program allows for real-time particle simulation with Newtonian physics, featuring interactive controls for particle manipulation and visual customization. The simulator also includes a custom cursor and on-screen control instructions.

## Features

- **Particle Simulation**: Visualize and interact with particles following Newtonian physics in real-time.
- **Interactive Controls**: Use the keyboard to change the gravity direction and toggle particle behaviors.
- **Resizable Window**: The game window can be resized for better user experience (Might not work on some devices :P

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Change the gravity direction.
- **Spacebar**: Toggle cursor following.
- **Esc**: Exit the application.
